# Universal Differential Equations (UDE) in Python

This is an implementation of Universal Differential Equations in Python for modeling the potassium sulfate batch crystallization in water, considering nucleation, growth, and dissolution.

The performance of the UDE is published in Chemical Engineering Research and Design in an article entitled "Improved Modelling of Crystallization Processes by Universal Differential Equations" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cherd.2023.11.032). 


# Data

Inside the data folder, there are two folders according to the article's organization:

- Training with all experiments: data used for training and testing the UDEs using all experimental data for the training.
- Training with some experiments: data used for training and testing the UDEs using part of the experimental data for the training.
