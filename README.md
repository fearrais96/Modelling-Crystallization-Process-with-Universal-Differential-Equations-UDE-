# Hybrid Model for Potassium Sulfate Batch Crystallization
> The aim of this project was develop a hybrid model for the potassium sulfate batch crystallization. The Universal Differential Equations (UDE) hybrid approach was used to develop this model. The nucleation, growth and dissolution rates were replaced by neural networks and combined to the population balance equations to predict the state variables.

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains the source code for State Hybrid Model for Potassium Sulfate Batch Crystallization, developed by Fernando Arrais Romero Dias Lima, Carine M. Rebello, Erbet A. Costa,
Vin√≠cius V. Santana, Marcellus G.F. de Moares, Amaro G. Barreto Jr., Argimiro R. Secchi, Maur√≠cio B. de Souza Jr. and Idelfonso B.R. Nogueira at the Laboratory of Software Development for Process Control and Optimization (LADES) - COPPE/UFRJ, in association with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

The purpose of this project is to develop a hybrid model code in Python and apply it to model nucleation, crystal growth and dissolution for the potassium sulfate batch crystallization.

## üöÄ Features
- Model replacing the growth (G) and nucleation (B) rates by neural networks
- Model replacing the growth (G) rate by neural network
- Model replacing the nucleation (B) rate by neural network
- Model replacing the dissolution rate (D) by neural network
